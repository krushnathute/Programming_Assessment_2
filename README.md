# Programming_Assessment_2

## INTRODUCTION TO THE DATASET

The dataset used in this analysis focuses on suicide cases in India, providing a comprehensive view of various factors influencing such incidents. The dataset includes information on suicides categorized by different parameters, such as year, state or union territory (UT), gender, age group, specific causes, and total counts. The data spans multiple years, allowing for the exploration of trends and patterns over time.


## LIBRARIES 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Final PRogramming AsS 22.ipynb`) that performs various analyses on suicide data. The analysis is carried out using Python libraries such as: 
1.Pandas, 
2.Matplotlib, 
3.Seaborn, 
4.Plotly,
5.SciPy, 
6.Statsmodels,
7.Geopandas.


## Overview of the Notebook
The notebook reads suicide data from a Suicides_by_causes_state.csv file.
Data cleaning and filtering are performed to exclude total values.
 The analysis includes:
  - Yearly trends of suicide cases.
  - Gender distribution of suicide cases over the years.
  - Age group analysis of suicide cases over the years.
  - Cause-wise analysis of suicide cases over the years.
  - Top causes of suicide cases.
  - State/UT-wise analysis of suicide cases.
  - Yearly trend for failure in examination.
  - Overall summary of suicide cases.
  - Percentage distribution of causes using various visualization techniques.
  - Regression analysis to analyze trends over the years.
  - Comparison of suicide rates in Andhra Pradesh to national or regional averages.
  - Spatial analysis using Geopandas, including choropleth maps.
  - Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
